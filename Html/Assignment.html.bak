		"The Sloths family is old.

When I say old, I mean like mammoth old. The Megatherium, an ancient ground sloth was hanging around the Earth a looong time ago. And they were big, as big as elephants, with claws the size of your forearm. Scary, huh? But don’t worry, not only were they herbivores, but also, we’re not living in the past. We’re living in the now, where sloths are teensy and cute and awesome."
